# Machine_Learning

## Machine learning experimentation with super resolutions. 
The *many* scripts in this repository are for learning to do machine/deep learning better.
Topics covered are: 
- Interpolation (interpolation.py),
- Model architecture and APIs (super_resolution_models.py, torch_model.py, subclassing.py),
- Data flows and pipelines (data_generators.py, custom_training_loops.py),
- Quick attempts at GAN architecture for super resolution (GAN.py, GAN_Subclass.py).

Other scripts are for preparing data (data_preprocessing.py), training models (train_super_resolution.py),
evaluating models (evaluation.py) or contain ancillary functions (functions.py).
